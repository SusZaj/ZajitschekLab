## Serious funders:

***European Research Council***    
This webpage is admittedly hard to navigate, so to spare the pain here's the direct link to Horizon2020 and in particular to the forthcoming Marie-Curie actions [H2020-MSCA-IF-2020](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/msca-if-2020;freeTextSearchKeyword=Marie%20Sklodowska-Curie%20Actions;typeCodes=1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCode=H2020;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=Default;sortQuery=openingDate;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState) (call opens 08/04/2020, grant submission deadline 09/09/2020)    
The [starting grants](https://erc.europa.eu/funding/starting-grants) are a little easier to find.
