Welcome to the Zajitschek Lab space!
We invite you to have a look around, see what we're currently working on, what we're interested in, what we've published so far. There's also some extra info about ourselves ([Susi](https://suszaj.github.io/ZajitschekLab/aboutme/), [Felix](https://suszaj.github.io/ZajitschekLab/aboutFelix/)), both professionally & private, and [current opportunities](https://suszaj.github.io/ZajitschekLab/opportunities/) to work with us at LJMU. Finally, we also provide some (hopefully!) useful resources on a wide range of topice - from writing to [R skills](https://suszaj.github.io/ZajitschekLab/R/), to dealing with stress... 
Enjoy!
