### Optimistic zebrafish    

How do personality and optimistic behaviour interact? Are bolder personality types alsso more optimistic? How can we influence animal "moods"? Are there sex differences in optimism? All these questions are still largely unknown, and we have only recently started exploring this field, in collaboration with the zebrafish team of the [Interdiscipliary Ecology and Evolution Lab](http://www.i-deel.org/), at UNSW.   

### The role of epigenetic effects in adapting to changing environments

Our research on zebrafish (*Danio rerio*) in the [Immler lab](http://www.ebc.uu.se/Research/IEG/evbiol/research/Immler/) 
at the EBC at Uppsala University (Sweden) investigated the interplay of haploid selection, phenotypic plasticity in sperm 
and epigenetic inheritance. Drawing on the current paradigm shift in evolutionary ecology, which combines genetic and 
non-genetic transgenerational inheritance mechanisms, a particular focus of this research was to study how variation 
in not only in male reproductive traits but also in paternal social environment mediates reproductive success. 

Specifically, I investigated the role of social environment on multiple levels, looking at fitness differences of offspring 
which are presumably transmitted to the offspring via epigenetic modifications in the paternal ejaculate.

### The interaction between population structure and behavior: studying dispersal   

During our postdoc at the CNRS in [Moulis (France)](http://www.ecoex-moulis.cnrs.fr/spip.php?article200) we primarily 
concentrated drawing the link between individual behaviour and  environmental common lizards (*Zootoca [formerly Lacerta] vivipara*). 
We found that the propensity to initiate movement is critically dependent on the type of substrate, the level of humidity, 
and the opportunity to thermoregulate. However, there are also indications that the social environment influences dispersal 
not only in respect to inbreeding and competition avoidance by the dispersing individuals, but that in the wild siblings may 
aim to facilitate the risky dispersal process for each other.


### Sexual selection and Inbreeding avoidance    

We investigated female mating behavior in guppies with a special focus on mechanisms related to inbreeding avoidance. We investigated findings on the negative effects of inbreeding on sperm quantity as well as inbreeding depression in sperm competition using artificial insemination techniques, and females preferences for mutivariate male ornamentation.
