 **PhD and Masters**
 
If you're UK resident, you can always opt to self-fund. This doesn't mean you'll have to pay all out of pocket, but apply for a government loan. This covers not only all University fees, but also leaves a small stipend for you to live on! This can always be supplemented with our opportunities to teach (i.e. paid demonstrating in undergrad courses), or if you opt for part-time study - you'll have anough time to work alongside your degree.

For international students, this may not be as easy: EU residents may still be eligible for a government loan, but as fees are sligtly higher no costs of living would be covered. Own funds / work alongside would be necessary...
