Stuck with few ideas on what to do for your final year project in Covid19 times? No opportunity to do labwork but always wondered if a meta-analysis could be a good idea? Check out our Intro guide & interactive course here to get you started:
 
[metaanalysis.zajitschek.net](https://metaanalysis.zajitschek.net/)

A short Intro for Biologists, from how to get started on your topic, hints for literature search and paper screening, to how and what to extract from your final set of papers - plus lots of relevant links if you want more in-depth information from the experts in this field! The real fun bit are the interactive R code blocks, which allow you to run your first meta analysis right on the website, plot your first forest plot, and look at publication bias - all right there, on the page! 

Some parts still require some work and potenially more explanation, we're still building! However, we belive it's already a great resource and hopefully helpful. Have fun checking it out!
