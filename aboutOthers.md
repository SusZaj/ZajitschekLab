Zhitian joined the lab in June 2023, and will be exploring the interactive &nbsp;&nbsp; effects of sleep and diet quality on fruit flies.    
     
He holds Masters degrees from University College London, United Kingdom, and Lanzhou University, China.    

   
# Alumni, Volunteers and Project students

***Sarah Plesser***  
Sarah was funded by a DAAD (Germany) funded summer internship, where she was leading the 2022 biodiverity survey on Byrom Street Campus. Furthermore, she conducted pilot studies on individual differences in zebrafish in response to ambiguous stimuli - so basically looking into differences in mood and optimism in zebrafish!
Sarah is currently pursuing her MSc in Ecology (University of Wurzburg, Germany).



***Amy Speers***  
Volunteer and invaluable assistant for the Wildlife Gardens Project, both in the field and the laboratory for insect identification. Amy is currently in her second year of her UG Zoology degree at LJMU.

***Veronica Manara***  
Veronica wanted to make use of her time in lockdown after her first year, and we designed a large-scale field study in behavioural ecology in BEES in Italy. Due to adverse circumstances the project was never completed, but the connections Veronica made during the planning phase have led to  very valuable network connections - and have resulted in her first publication during second year of undergrad: **Manara, V & Zajitschek S.** (2021)  A brief introduction to the ecology and
collective behaviour of the honeybee. *In:* Good beekeeping practices for sustainable apiculture. FAO Animal Production and Health Guidelines (FAO, Apimondia, CAAS, IZSLT), pp43-46. [https://doi.org/10.4060/cb5353en](https://doi.org/10.4060/cb5353en)  
   
Veronica is now working at the Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute in Rome, connecting beekeepers and scientists, advancing good beekeeping practices and biosecurity measures and limit loss of pollinators.
