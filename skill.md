## Organisational skills
- don't procrastinate (see [here](https://procrastination.com/what-is-procrastination) and [here](https://alphaefficiency.com/4-types-procrastination-beat/) to find out what the problem is and how you may beat it)
- be organised. Use calendars, planner, tools.

***I recommend:***
- Google calendar. Easiest way to stay on top of appointments and deadlines.
- [freedcamp](https://freedcamp.com). Great tool to integrate deadlines, tasks & projects with milestones.
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com). Good for daily tick-offs, but may take a while to get the hang of it.
- VISUALIZE your project / paper / breakfast plans: create [VUE mindmaps](https://vue.tufts.edu)! Absolutely awesome.... see below
