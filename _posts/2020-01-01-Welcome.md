Welcome to the Zajitschek Lab space!
We invite you to have a look around, see what we're currently working on, what we're interested in, what we've published so far. There's also some extra info about ourselves, both professionally & private, and current opportunities to work with us at LJMU. Finally, we also provide some (hopefully!) useful resources on a wide range of topice - from writing to R skills, to dealing with stress... 
Enjoy!
