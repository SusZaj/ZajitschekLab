# Alumni, Volunteers and Project students

***Sarah Plesser***
Sarah was funded by a DAAD (Germany) funded summer internship, where she was leading the 2022 biodiverity survey on Byrom Street Campus. Furthermore, she conducted pilot studies on individual differences in zebrafish in response to ambiguous stimuli. Sarah is currently pursuing her MSc in Ecology (University of Wurzburg, Germany).

***Amy Speers***
Volunteer and invaluable assistant for the Wildlife Gardens Project, both in the field and the laboratory for insect identification. Amy is currently in her second year of her UG Zoology degree at LJMU.

***Veronica Manara***
Veronica wanted to make use of her time in locdown after her first year, and designed a large-scale study on behavioural ecology in BEES in Italy. Due to adverse circumstances the project was never completed, but the connections made during the planning phase have led to a publiocation
